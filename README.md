Bluz Remote Files
==========
Bluz is a Development Kit (DK) that implements the Wiring language and talks to the [Particle](https://www.particle.io/) cloud through Bluetooth Low Energy. It can be accessed through a REST API and programmed from a Web IDE.

The Bluz Remote is a device that can be used to control many Particle projects. It provides a simple layout for buttons thaqt publish events, the events can then be subscribed to by various Particle services for control.

Example projects to control include:
* Robotic projects 
* IR Transmitters to control TV's, DVD's, etc
* RF Transmitters to control light switches, outlets, etc
